The MotorPH Automated Payroll System is an important initiative aimed at modernizing and streamlining MotorPH's payroll processes, in line with the company's growth objectives. The system prioritizes efficiency, accuracy, and legal compliance, and seeks to automate manual payroll tasks, reduce errors, and save time. It is designed to be scalable, adaptable, and secure, making it an integral part of MotorPH's organizational structure.

## Introduction

MotorPH was established in 2020 and its mission is to be the first choice for Filipinos searching for competitive and affordable motorcycles. From a purely online presence, MotorPH's objective is to expand its business by opening physical stores in different parts of the Philippines. Recognizing the pivotal role of a robust employee foundation in this growth journey, MotorPH is prioritizing the modernization of its payroll system.

To support its ambitious expansion plans, MotorPH is overhauling its current payroll system, transitioning from manual processes to a streamlined and automated approach. This strategic initiative aims to accelerate payroll processes, enhance accuracy, and ensure compliance with regulations. By automating payroll tasks, MotorPH aims to minimize administrative workloads, reduce errors, and save valuable time. This not only guarantees timely and precise salary disbursements for employees but also optimizes costs, freeing up resources for MotorPH to concentrate on its core expansion priorities.

### Log-in (HR head's POV)

### Employee Management - Add Employee
#### Step 1: Open Employee Management Module
![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/3b8a5f9d-b5ef-49e8-8515-f81fedb8cedd)

#### Step 2: Press the Add Employee Button

*After the user presses the add employee button, a new row at the end of the table is added where the user can input details .*

#### Step 3: Input New Employee Details and Press Save Changes
![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/4d3bb159-68eb-4f33-9767-2bb65d9e2010)
*System confirms the addition of the employee into the database. MySQL Database updates and adds employee to the Database**

![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/1ac2753f-2970-41f7-ab8f-21d1af92005c)
There's an issue with how Employee IDs are assigned in the application's table. When a new employee is added, the table automatically increases the ID by 1 based on the last employee shown. However, if an employee is deleted, the database remembers this and assigns the next available ID, creating a mismatch between the table and the database. For instance, if an employee with ID 35 is deleted, the table still expects the next employee to have ID 36, while the database recognizes ID 36 as available and assigns it to the next employee. This inconsistency can cause confusion and errors in the system. 
That's why, in the pictures, even though the next employee added should have been assigned ID 39 according to the table, the database records it as 41 due to the discrepancy. However, after the completed addition, the table refreshes and corrects this issue promptly by synchronizing with the database.


### Employee Management - Delete Employee
#### Step 1: Select the row of the employee to be deleted
![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/744cf64b-bd13-4cbf-a290-5d23b3607515)

*The system implements a double-check mechanism when deleting an employee.*

#### Step 3: Employee Deletion Confirmation
![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/9f03942a-be48-4fcb-9724-bf529836f538)

*The employee with emp id 38 is deleted from the database.*


### Employee Management - Edit Employee
![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/26df1854-1923-40f8-841d-5f318d248956)
