## Introduction

MotorPH was established in 2020 and its mission is to be the first choice for Filipinos searching for competitive and affordable motorcycles. From a purely online presence, MotorPH's objective is to expand its business by opening physical stores in different parts of the Philippines.

This strategic initiative aims to accelerate payroll processes, enhance accuracy, and ensure compliance with regulations. By automating payroll tasks, MotorPH aims to minimize administrative workloads, reduce errors, and save valuable time.
