## Introduction

MotorPH was established in 2020 and its mission is to be the first choice for Filipinos searching for competitive and affordable motorcycles. From a purely online presence, MotorPH's objective is to expand its business by opening physical stores in different parts of the Philippines.

To support its ambitious expansion plans, MotorPH is overhauling its current payroll system, transitioning from manual processes to a streamlined and automated approach. This strategic initiative aims to accelerate payroll processes, enhance accuracy, and ensure compliance with regulations. By automating payroll tasks, MotorPH aims to minimize administrative workloads, reduce errors, and save valuable time. This not only guarantees timely and precise salary disbursements for employees but also optimizes costs, freeing up resources for MotorPH to concentrate on its core expansion priorities.
