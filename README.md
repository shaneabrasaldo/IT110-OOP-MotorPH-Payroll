## Employee Management Module - Add Employee
### Step 1: Open Employee Management Module

*After the user presses the add employee button, a new row at the end of the table is added where the user can input details .*

### Step 3: Input New Employee Details and Press Save Changes
![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/4d3bb159-68eb-4f33-9767-2bb65d9e2010)
*System confirms the addition of the employee into the database. MySQL Database updates and adds employee to the Database**

![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/1ac2753f-2970-41f7-ab8f-21d1af92005c)
There's an issue with how Employee IDs are assigned in the application's table. When a new employee is added, the table automatically increases the ID by 1 based on the last employee shown. However, if an employee is deleted, the database remembers this and assigns the next available ID, creating a mismatch between the table and the database. For instance, if an employee with ID 35 is deleted, the table still expects the next employee to have ID 36, while the database recognizes ID 36 as available and assigns it to the next employee. This inconsistency can cause confusion and errors in the system. 
That's why, in the pictures, even though the next employee added should have been assigned ID 39 according to the table, the database records it as 41 due to the discrepancy. However, after the completed addition, the table refreshes and corrects this issue promptly by synchronizing with the database.

## Employee Management Module - Delete Employee
### Step 1: Select the row of the employee to be deleted
![image](https://github.com/shaneabrasaldo/Java-Calculator/assets/124635709/744cf64b-bd13-4cbf-a290-5d23b3607515)

*The system implements a double-check mechanism when deleting an employee.*

### Step 3: Employee Deletion Confirmation
